title: The Problem with Facebook Notifications
---

<div class="post_body">
						<p>Notifications in general are just about the most important problem in consumer software right now, at least for me. How frequently I'm interrupted by my phone (or even how often I click the damn red badge at the top of the Facebook page)&nbsp;has a direct effect on my quality of life.</p>
<p>One important problem with notifications is priority, and this is particularly acute with Facebook since I am more excited about someone posting on my wall than I am about comment 100 on a long thread where I posted comment 17. But it's not just comments vs. wall posts - I do really care about a comment immediately after mine that responds to me!</p>
<p>The main culprit of annoying Facebook notifications is comments. There is no way to distinguish between a discussion, where follow up comments are relevant, or a series of unrelated comments. Here are 3 potential solutions, in order of my preference.</p>
<ol class='long'>
  <li>Have threaded conversations, even just 2 levels deep for simplicity. If you're replying to my comment, I get a notification. If you're adding an unrelated comment, I don't need to see it.</li>
  <li> Facebook should make it easy to "unsubscribe" from a conversation so I stop seeing notifications <em>just for that conversation</em>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Conversation notifications are opt-in - in addition to commenting, I have to subscribe to receive further notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Update (1/11/2012):</strong> Looks like Facebook implemented #2 ("Unfollow Post" below). Very nice - can't wait for this to make it to mobile.</p>
