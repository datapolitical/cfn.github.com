<p>Shortly after the President's <a href='http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/obama-sex-marriage-legal-16312940'>interview yesterday</a>, I got in a debate over Twitter with Glenn Greenwald, a Salon writer, over whether or not Obama's support of gay marriage should be a single-issue decider for gay and lesbian voters. He wrote:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-in-reply-to="200342863836483584"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/fakedansavage">fakedansavage</a> I think gay people, like all voters, can/should make voting decisions based on a wide array of issues, not just this one</p>&mdash; Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/200343222197829632" data-datetime="2012-05-09T21:55:21+00:00">May 9, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>I responded, and he came back:</p>

<p>No, Glenn Greenwald, I don't think only of myself when voting. I live in San Francisco, where I feel almost no discrimination or persecution for being gay. I will presumably be able to marry the person I love by the time I'm ready. I think of the gay teenagers in North Carolina, who go to bed every night thinking they are worthless, hearing their parents and friends debating the political issue of the day, talking about how they need to keep the faggots from getting married.</p>

<p>I don't think you need to be gay to think about suicidal teenagers or loving families being denied basic legal protections. I'd like to think when my straight friends, family members and neighbors go to the ballot box next November, they also think about the millions of human beings that this election matters to. To steal a line from Fred Wilson's <a href='http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/05/same-sex-marriage.html' target='_blank'>blog post on the subject</a>, "It is about basic human decency." Frank Bruni at the New York Times said it <a href='http://bruni.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/no-matter-their-impact-historic-words/' target='_blank'>more eloquently than I can</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find myself thinking about all the teenagers and young adults out there who cower in silence because they worry about being ostracized if they speak the truth about their sexual orientation. I think about the ones who are bullied, even the ones who contemplate taking their own lives.</p>
 
<p>And I think about what it will mean to them to hear the president say what he did today, not because they’re focused on marriage but because they’re buoyed by any and every reassurance that there’s nothing wrong with them, nothing inferior about them. Today their president gave them that reassurance.</p>

<p>I think about how it would have felt to me when I was 16, and fearful, and often deeply, deeply depressed, to hear a president say what ours did today. I can’t imagine it. In the three decades since, our country has traveled an enormous distance, and today is a poignant and compelling marker of that.</p>

<p>This isn't about politics. This isn't about the details of foreign policy agendas, economic policy, health care, or anything else that is a matter of opinion. This isn't about weddings. This is about <a href='http://bruni.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/societys-message-to-gays/' target='_blank'>the message society sends to gay people</a>. This is about loving your neighbors as yourself. Glenn, if you had a gay daughter, could you look her in the eye and say, "You deserve to be treated as a second class citizen because I'm afraid my health care premium might go up"? It would certainly be different if Obama was intentionally slaughtering civilians in Afghanistan, but the principle stays the same - it's about human decency. No, Glenn Greenwald, I don't think there's a political issue important enough for me to ignore basic human decency.</p>
