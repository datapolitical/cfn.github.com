While you may own the idea you don't own the conversation. The problem with a comments section is that it dictates the terms of the discussion by focusing on the initial idea. By allowing users to create Branches (and then simply linking to them), you promote a greater dialog while still controlling what content you associate with your main idea. There's no law that says every branch that links to your post must be featured on your site. 

Most Jekyll blogs I've seen use Disqus for their comments. Personally, I don't see the upside to handing over the content to a 3rd party that lets you display it on your site vs handing it over to a company that better promotes discussion on their more popular site. By encouraging people to Branch my blog post, I get pageviews from the backlink. I give Branch the endorsement to host discussions about my site, and in return I get promotion on a platform far more popular than my blog. From a writer's perspective, (at least, one whose goal is to promote the exchange of ideas) pushing people to use Branch provides far greater value than hosting my own comments. 

The only problem I have is the chicken and the egg issue. Right now, there's no Branch button, and no way to moderate Branches that link to my post. @Joshm, please give me this feature. Until that happens, I can encourage people to download the "Take it to Branch" bookmarklet and suggest that they add me (@chrisFnicholson) to the conversation so I'll know it exists. It's not ideal ATM, but if you're blogging with Jekyll it's not because there's already a massive community and thousands of themes and widgets. These are hacker blogs, and that means DIY. To borrow from our presidential candidates, when it comes to a hacker blog, "You didn't build that" underlying code, but what you see on the surface, what makes you different, most of the time, "you did build that."
