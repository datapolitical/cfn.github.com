I'm writing this on my iPhone (full disclosure, this will be partially about blogging). It feels incredibly odd, like eating pancakes with a caviar fork. I love this device, but complex content creation is not its strong suit. 

Yet, it's awesome with micro-creation. Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr all work beautifully on mobile, because they aren't designed to feel like a blank canvas. People have time to revise because they only have to review 140 characters.

The barrier for content creation is friction; it takes far longer to get on my laptop when I want to write. Even if the idea deserves long-form, I'll post on Facebook and then share the post on Twitter (this practice has to stop, but that's a whole other can of tuna).

So I'm writing this on my iPhone because I know if I add a reminder, the actual work I have to finish will take over and I won't bother to write anything today.

What scares me is that the guys 10 years younger than me don't use a PC unless you put a gun to their heads. The result is obvious, they love short-form composition. Tumblr gains on Blogger not on its merits (though it's wicked smart), but on its ease of use among 14-21 year olds.

So the question is simple: will a generation raised on smartphones create long-form content?

I now proceed to post this, share it on Facebok and Twitter, and then take it to Branch (when that's live, I'll update this with link).

Same warning: this was written on a mobile device, so there may be errors I did not catch.
