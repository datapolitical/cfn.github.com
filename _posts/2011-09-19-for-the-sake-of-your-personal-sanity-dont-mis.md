From this January through June, I was working on a startup called <a href="http://outdrsy.com/" target="_blank">Outdrsy</a>. That's pronounced Outdoorsy. But without the two 'O's in door. O-u-t-d-r-s-y. That's right. I liked the name Outdoorsy for my mobile/social/local/group-buying/pivoting/buzzword-generating service for outdoorsy people but didn't have the money to shell out for an english-word domain name and Twitter handle. Outdrsy was available for both, and it seemed like a good idea at the time. Little did I know that I would spend the next six months repeating variations on the first four sentences of this article. Over and over again.</p>
<p>Apparently nobody in the decision making chain at Netflix has worked at a misspelled Web 2.0 company before. Reed Hastings (Netflix CEO) and most Netflix employees are going to spend the next few months of their lives going through a similar ritual.</p>
<p><em>Dinner Party Rando:</em> "Oh, you're the CEO of Netflix? Cool. You guys just, like, totally renamed your business or something, right? Flixster or something?"<br> <em>Reed</em>: "No, Qwikster. Flixster is another company in the movie business. We're Qwikster."<br> <em>Dinner Party Rando:</em> "Qwixter... you spell that with an 'X' or something, right?" <br> <em>Reed</em>: "No, with a 'W and a 'K'. Q-w-i-k-s-t-e-r."</p>
<p>But Reed is going to have it even worse. The conversation won't end there. DPR will have a flash of remembrance after the spelling of the name: "Oh, that's right! Qwikster was a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/19/the-guy-behind-the-qwikster-twitter-account-realizes-what-he-has-wants-a-mountain-of-cash/" target="_blank">partially brain dead stoner on Twitter</a>. That was hilarious."</p>
<p>So what on earth possessed Netflix to make such an obviously atrocious branding decision? I have 3 hypotheses. Let me know in the comments if you can come up with a better explanation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Netflix is intentionally trying to destroy the DVD business because it's competing with the core business of their future, streaming content.</strong> In this scenario, the marketing team probably had a competition to come up with the dorkiest Web 2.0 sounding name they could think of. The decision makers at Netflix have fun at work, and when someone threw up <a href="http://twitter.com/qwikster" target="_blank">@Qwikster</a> on a projector in the conference room, Qwikster's fate was sealed. This hypothesis is consistent with Mark Suster's explanation for why <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/09/19/why-reed-hastings-should-be-applauded-for-netflix-split/" target="_blank">splitting the business was a great decision</a>, which I agree with (modulo the branding decision).</li>
<li><strong>An epic publicity stunt.</strong> If they had named Qwikster something sensible, like, say, "Mailflix" (not saying that's great, but it doesn't take much to beat Qwikster), I wouldn't be writing this blog post. People would have stopped talking about Netflix at 10am and switched to talking about more exciting news, like the story that <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/19/justin-bieber-startup-investor/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber is about to become an angel investor</a>. Again, this theory gives Netflix executives for having a great sense of humor and foresight to understand the making of a viral meme.</li>
<li><strong>The branding team at <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Netflix</span> Qwikster should be fired.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>p.s. I misspelled <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Qwixter</span> Qwikster at least once during the writing of this blog post.</p>
