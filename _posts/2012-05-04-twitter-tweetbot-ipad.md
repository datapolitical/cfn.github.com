This is a follow up on my last post, [6 reasons to use Tweetbot instead of the official Twitter app](/6-reasons-to-use-tweetbot-instead-of-twitter/). After spending some time on Tweetbot for iPad, I've come to the opposite conclusion.

Most of the flaws of the Twitter iPhone app are solved by the extra real estate. DMs and Lists are easily accessible from the side menu. I don't need readability - the extra screen real estate and Verizon LTE make mobile optimization mostly unnecessary. The official Twitter app does a good job reinventing itself to take advantage of the iPad form factor, while Tweetbot feels like a quick port of the iPhone app.

In the Tweetbot app, everything is modal - if you click a link or expand a conversation, your timeline disappears, and the entire screen is filled with the new window. You have to close it to go back. There are wide, sweeping animations for all of these changes which make the app feel slow and cumbersome. If I want to favorite or retweet, I have to close the modal window and go back. Lame. Seeing a few tweets blown up to fill the iPad screen makes me feel like I'm playing with an oversized plush toy.

In the Twitter app, on the other hand, opening a conversation or link fades and slides the timeline but leaves it visible. The right-hand side of the screen has more than enough real estate to read an article or conversation, and I can quickly go back to the timeline without feeling disrupted. If I want to expand the website to full screen, that's a single tap away. If I want to favorite or retweet something in the middle of reading it, I can do that from the top right toolbar without disrupting my reading.

Overall, the official Twitter app provides a beautiful iPad optimized experience. Save the $2.99 and buy yourself a PBR.
