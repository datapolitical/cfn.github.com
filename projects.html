    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <article>
      <p>I am a "full-stack" software developer. The first program I wrote was a quadratic equation solver for TI-83 in 7th grade. Since then I've moved on from programming calculators to developing websites, running machine learning experiments on computational biology data, coding Windows software, building mobile apps, and developing more websites.</p>
      <h2>GoPollGo</h2>
      <p>I am currently a developer and employee #1 at <a href='http://gopollgo.com/'>real-time polling service GoPollGo</a>, where I've worked on everything from designing and implementing our mobile website to migrating our back-end from MySQL to MongoDB. I get to code Ruby all day and play around with fun new technologies like CoffeeScript and Backbone.js. Drew Olanoff from The Next Web says <a href='http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/10/05/gopollgo-is-the-quickest-way-to-track-public-opinion-on-the-web/' target='_blank'>GoPollGo is the quickest way to track public opinion on the web</a> and our users include ESPN and Netflix.</p>
      <h2>Outdrsy</h2>
      <p>For 6 months after leaving Microsoft, I worked as a solo founder on a startup called Outdrsy that was intended to be a community organizing site for outdoor recreation. It didn't pan out, and what I learned from it will be the subject of a blog post in the near future!</p>
      <h2>Microsoft</h2>
      <p>At Microsoft, I worked on a variety of projects starting with an internship in Dynamics CRM, working on the front-end of the enterprise web service. When I started full time, I moved to Windows Live where I worked first on Sync and then <a href='http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2010/07/26/messenger-companion-have-conversations-with-your-friends-directly-in-internet-explorer.aspx'>Messenger Companion</a>, a social networking add-on for Internet Explorer, for which I was the primary user interface developer.</p>
      <h2>Princeton University</h2>
      <p>I graduated from Princeton in 2008 with honors in Computer Science and a certificate in Quantitative and Computational Biology. For my senior thesis, <em>Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Functional Genomic Relationships</em>, I explored machine learning classification algorithms for predicting relationships between genes based on ginormous aggregated gene expression "microarray" data sets and was able to improve the prediction accuracy by a few percentage points. Along the way I learned various ways to hog the CS department's Beowulf cluster.</p>
