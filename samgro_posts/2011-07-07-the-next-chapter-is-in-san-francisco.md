<p>Sometime in late May, I had an interesting chat with <a href="http://andybrett.com/" target="_blank">Andy Brett</a>. We were talking about our startups and the struggles I was having defining a clear business vision for <a href="http://outdrsy.com" target="_blank">Outdrsy</a>. Andy told me that he thought I should really meet his former co-worker Ben, founder of <a href="http://gopollgo.com/" target="_blank">GoPollGo</a>. Apparently Ben was looking to hire his first employee, and if I ever decided to move on from Outdrsy I should get in touch with him. I said something to the tune of "Thanks, but no thanks" and the conversation continued.</p>
<p>A month later, I spent a week in California trying to figure out my life, my career, investigating new startup ideas, and hanging out with old friends. I was staying with Ryan Corces-Zimmerman, who happens to share a house with Ben of GoPollGo. Ben and I got along quite well, and for some reason he decided to offer me a job (probably <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Bensign/status/85462057960476672" target="_blank">our mutual love of Katy Perry</a>). Last night, I accepted that offer. It looks like I'll be starting on August 15. The office is in Palo Alto, but I'll be looking for an apartment in San Francisco and hope to move down and get settled the week before I start.</p>
<p>For those of you who are fans of Outdrsy and have supported me, mentored me, pitched my startup to your friends, retweeted my blog posts, and kept me sane, I really appreciate everything you've done, and just because I'm starting a new job doesn't mean Outdrsy is over. I can't call you all out by name, but you know who you are. I just came to the conclusion that it's a great side project that I'm passionate about working on in my spare time, but not quite right for a full time business. Stay tuned for an iPhone app.</p>
<p>Seattle friends and fellow startuppers, I will miss you all a ton, but look forward to visiting - cheap round trip airfare means I can enjoy Seattle summer but skip the long rainy winter! Ha! In the meantime, I'm going to live the rest of the summer like it's my last summer here, because I don't know when I'll be back.</p>
<p>Time to ask the audience - what do I need to do in Seattle before moving away?? I'll create a GoPollGo poll with the best answers :)</p>
<p>p.s. I'm proud of myself for making it through this entire blog post, until now, without using the word "adventure". There, I said it.</p>
